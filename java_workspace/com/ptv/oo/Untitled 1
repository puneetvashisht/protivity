OO Principles
	1. Encapsulation
		Public(least restrictive), Protected, Default, Public
	2. Inheritance: is-a relationship
	3. Polymorphism: Using same name for multiple purposes
		a. Overloading: using same method name by differing arguments (type/number)
		b. Overriding: different classes (parent/child) -- same method signature
	4. Abstraction
		Abstract class & Interfaces
	
	
	Manager is a Employee
	Plane is a Vehicle
	 Not correct - Employee has an Address
	 
	Vehicle-> Car, Plane
	Engine -> PlaneEngine
	 
	 
	 Interface (everything abstract)   ---------   Abstract classes (some abstract, some defined) .. Concrete classes(all methods should be defined)
